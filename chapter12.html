          <h1 class="mt-4">THE YOGA OF MEDITATION</h1><br>

          <p align="justify">[1] Sri Rama said: O Parameshvara! Please teach me the meditation method, also prescribed time, place, and rules.</p>

          <p align="justify">[2] Bhagavan said: O Rama! Listen carefully to the method and rules of meditation.</p>

          <p align="justify">[3] The bodies of all the deities have been created from my portion only. Therefore, whosoever worships to whichever deity, all such devotees attain me only.</p>

          <p align="justify">[4] As prescribed in the scriptures, without realising the fact that I am the enjoyer of everything, whosoever worships me only gets the limited fruit. The target of all the actions and the giver of all the fruits is me only.</p>

          <p align="justify">[5] Whichever form of god one worships, in that form itself, I appear and fulfil wishes.</p>

          <p align="justify">[6] Whosoever worships me with devotion, I give fruits to every such person. There is no doubt in this.</p>

          <p align="justify">[7] Even if a great sinner is remorseful and worships me with devotion, that would be considered as equivalent to a forest recluse sage.</p>

          <p align="justify">[8] One who keeps firm devotion in me and sees no difference between oneself and me, such a devotee would remain unstained even by killing a living being.</p>

          <p align="justify">[9] Meditation is defined as attainment of oneness with the deity meditated upon through continuous contemplation without interruption by any other thought. The wise scholars have categorised the meditation in two types; visual images and sound symbols.</p>

          <p align="justify">[10] The visual image meditation is of three types; Sampada, Adhyasa and Samvarga. When an inferior object is used as a symbol to represent superior reality, it is called Sampada meditation. For example, when a Shivalinga is worshipped as Shiva, the devotee forgets about the Shivalinga and thinks only of Lord Shiva.</p>

          <p align="justify">[11] When the symbol chosen is itself a superior object and dominates the meditative field of mind, it is called Adhyasa meditation. For example, when the sun is mediated as eternal consciousness. One superimposes upon the sun attributes of consciousness like all-pervading, witness, self-luminous, etc.</p>

          <p align="justify">[12] When contemplation is done on the basis of similarity of functions. It is called Samvarga meditation. For example, the cosmic air withdraws everything into itself at the time of dissolution. Similarly, the vital air in a person's body withdraws sense organs into itself during sleep. Hence, one may meditate on these two as identical.</p>

          <p align="justify">[13] The mantra becomes awakened when it becomes connected to the basic rhythm of consciousness in the depths of one's heart. It is called sound symbol meditation. For example, the mystic syllable 'Om'.</p>

          <p align="justify">[14] Wherever one's mind and heart get firmly established, one can sit and perform meditation there. Visiting sacred places of pilgrimage for meditation is useless indeed.</p>

          <p align="justify">[15] One should sit in a peaceful place on a seat made of any soft cloth, should keep the back straight, should keep the head, throat and back firm and straight in one line.</p>

          <p align="justify">[16] Then one should apply the holy ash on the body, and by subduing senses with firm devotion, should start yoga.</p>

          <p align="justify">[17] One who does not keep his mind in his control, his senses also remain like the uncontrolled horses. One who has no wisdom, and one who is not of cleansed heart, such a person doesn't attain liberation.</p>

          <p align="justify">[18] Knowledge being the charioteer, mind being the reins, senses the horses, and body being the chariot; one should reach the final destination that is me. One should purify one's heart slowly by discarding Rajas and Tamas qualities.</p>

          <p align="justify">[19] A wise one whose mind and senses are controlled, being of a cleansed heart attains liberation.</p>

          <p align="justify">[20] The one who is beyond the mind, who is beyond the tasks of creation, maintenance and destruction, who is immersed in the bliss of wisdom, who is of the Ardhanareeswara form, who wears tiger skin as the garments, who has his hand in blessing posture, the blue necked and three eyed, who smears ash on the body, such a picture of mine has to be meditated upon by the yogi.</p>

          <p align="justify">[21] Considering the soul as the upper fire stick, considering the Omkara as the lower fire stick, when the yogi rubs them together under the process of knowledge, it gives the flame of my vision.</p>

          <p align="justify">[22] Either by reciting Vedas, or by learning scriptures, one cannot attain me. But, one with a cleansed heart who meditates or thinks of me always, I get pleased with such a pure devotee and become trapped in devotion.</p>

          <p align="justify">[23] An unrighteous person, a disturbed soul, one not having a cleansed heart, such people cannot attain me. I can only be attained through divine knowledge. Whatever creation exists that supreme reality is nothing but me, this fact whosoever realises, that becomes freed from the bonds of this world and gets liberated.</p>

          <p align="justify">[24] The one residing in the hearts of all creatures, such a formless self, is me who is the witness of everything. One who meditates on me, seeing me in all creatures, such a yogi gets permanent rest called liberation. Others don't gain this.</p>

          <p align="justify">[25] The way a single fire appears in various colours and forms while burning in various places, yet it remains formless everywhere; the same way despite residing in various forms, I remain untouched with all kinds of happiness and sorrows.</p>

          <p align="justify">[26] One who realises me as the essence of all Vedas, such a human gains liberation. There is no other way to liberation than knowing me in reality. </p>

          <p align="justify">[27] One who knows me as the ancient being who in the beginning created Brahma and gave him the Vedas, one who realises me as the lord of all demigods; such a yogi doesn't fall into the mouth of death.</p>
