          <h1 class="mt-4"><u>CHAPTER 13</u></h1>
          <h1 class="mt-4">THE YOGA OF LIBERATION</h1><br>

          <p align="justify">[1] Sage Suta said: After listening to the meditation details, 
            Rama started asking the details about liberation.</p>

          <p align="justify">[2] Rama said: O Lord! Kindly grace me by explaining the 
            symptoms of liberation and related details.</p>

          <p align="justify">[3] Bhagavan said: O Rama, Listen! Mukti is of five types; 
            Salokya, Sarupya, Samipya, Sayujya, and Kaivalya.</p>

          <p align="justify">[4] One who worships me without asking anything, comes to 
            my abode and enjoys it. This is called Salokya Mukti.</p>

          <p align="justify">[5] Those who don't have any desires and realises me among 
            the superior ones and worships me, they get my kind of form. 
            This is called Sarupya Mukti.</p>

          <p align="justify">[6] Those who keep me in mind always for my sake, whatever 
            they do, whatever they eat, whatever they offer to the sacrificial 
            fire, whatever they donate, whatever penance they perform; 
            they enjoy prosperity in my abode along with me. This is called 
            Samipya Mukti.</p>

          <p align="justify">[7] Those who have all the sattvic qualities and realises me as 
            the Paramatma knowing the nonduality between them and me, 
            they gain Sayujya Mukti.</p>

          <p align="justify">[8] Becoming one with the eternal self is called Kaivalya Mukti 
            or absolute liberation. The self being the truth, knowledge, 
            bliss, beyond all dharmas, beyond the mind and speech, should 
            be considered as my pure form.</p>

          <p align="justify">[9] As the clouds are seen in the sky but have no reality, 
            similarly this entire mobile and immobile creation is being seen in me.</p>

          <p align="justify">[10] When my formless state is realised by a yogi, the duality 
            ceases to exist, thereafter, one always remains in the state of bliss.</p>

          <p align="justify">[11] There is no space, time, directions and creatures different 
            from me. Nothing exists other than me, I alone remain.</p>

          <p align="justify">[12] None can see me with the eyes of flesh. However, with a 
            steady mind being inward focused, one can see me within 
            oneself, such one gains a final abode called liberation.</p>

          <p align="justify">[13] Rama Said: O Parameshvara! Kindly shower your grace 
            on me and explain how one can gain a pure form of devotion.</p>

          <p align="justify">[14] Bhagavan said: One gaining renunciation, being merciful 
            and kind, being impartial between friends and family, keeping 
            deep interest in authentic scriptures, in order to gain self-
            knowledge, should approach a proper guru.</p>

          <p align="justify">[15] By serving that guru for a long time, by his grace one must 
            learn with firm understanding all the secrets of the eternal self.</p>

          <p align="justify">[16] One should day and night, without any laziness; listen, 
            think and deeply contemplate Vedanta.</p>

          <p align="justify">[17] Remaining with good qualities, being free from ego and 
            attachments, being devoid of company, always trying to find 
            god, one gains a pure form of devotion.</p>

          <p align="justify">[18] After the destruction of actions, one gains self-realisation 
            sooner and the other gains it later.</p>

          <p align="justify">[19] Even if one has earned virtues and vices for a billion births, 
            they can only be destroyed through divine knowledge and can 
            never be exhausted through actions.</p>

          <p align="justify">[20] After self-realisation, whatever deeds are done, they do not 
            bind one, and one remains untouched with those actions and 
            their fruits.</p>

          <p align="justify">[21] Whatever past actions come along with the body of Jiva 
            that gets destroyed by direct experience only, but cannot be 
            destroyed through just intellectual knowledge.</p>

          <p align="justify">[22] Being devoid of pride, leaving all attachments, and 
            remaining sinless when one sees self within all creatures and 
            sees all creatures within self, one becomes free from the 
            gravitational pull of life.</p>

          <p align="justify">[23] When all the desires are discarded, then Jiva gains 
            liberation. Moksha is nothing but gaining self-knowledge. The 
            way a ripe fruit falls from a tree inevitably. Similarly, for a 
            person who has attained self-knowledge, liberation becomes inevitable.</p>

          <p align="justify">[24] The supreme consciousness doesn't leave whether one is 
            in a sacred place of pilgrimage or in an untouchable's house; 
            this state of mind when attained, one gains liberation for sure.</p>

          <p align="justify">[25] Mixing with good and bad people, sleeping anywhere, 
            eating the prohibited items, or whatever is done by an 
            enlightened person, it doesn't make a difference.</p>

          <p align="justify">[26] The cream separated from milk never dissolves in milk 
            again, similarly, the devotee after attaining liberation never 
            falls into the world again.</p>
