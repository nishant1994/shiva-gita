          <h1 class="mt-4"><u>CHAPTER 11</u></h1>
          <h1 class="mt-4">THE NATURE OF SOUL</h1><br>

          <p align="justify">[1] Bhagavan Said: O Rama! When the eaten food and drunken fluids are digested, from that stuff the gross body gains its life force. Either due to disease, or due to old age, or due to excessive production of phlegm, the intensity of digestive fire inside the belly declines, thus consumed food and fluids do not get digested.</p>

          <p align="justify">[2] In that scenario, in the absence of life force, the nerves become dry. The essence which maintains all nerves is called the Samana wind. When there is a lack of life force, there becomes an imbalance between the gross and subtle bodies.</p>

          <p align="justify">[3] The way fruits fall down from the creepers after ripening, similarly, this subtle body gets separated from the gross body.</p>

          <p align="justify">[4] Together with the vasanas, the primary wind with other nine winds move upwards, influenced with knowledge, action and past experiences, either through the path of eyes, or through head the Jiva rises upwards till the all-pervading sky where the Paramatma enters the subtle body.</p>

          <p align="justify">[5] Till the time the Jiva gets liberation, it keeps on taking births again and again.</p>

          <p align="justify">[6] One who enjoys sinful deeds, would enter a punishment body after death and would undergo various tortures in hell.</p>

          <p align="justify">[7] One who has done sacrificial rituals and sacred deeds in one's life goes to the abode of ancestors and from there attains a divine body and goes to the abode of the moon.</p>

          <p align="justify">[8] Together with the moon, Jiva enjoys there till one's balance of good deeds lasts, and after that again one comes back to earth and takes birth.</p>

          <p align="justify">[9] One discards the body of enjoyment and wears the subtle body again, and gains the attributes of sky, air, water, one by one and from that water becomes a cloud, then becomes rain and again transforms itself into the food items.</p>

          <p align="justify">[10] They take the form of various creatures. Few born in the form of immobile creation.</p>

          <p align="justify">[11] The food grains in the form of which this Jiva came to earth, get eaten by the creatures and that Jiva who is in the form of food takes the form of male and female seeds.</p>

          <p align="justify">[12] Later on, some couples unite their seeds and give birth to this Jiva in gross form through the womb.</p>

          <p align="justify">[13] Subsequently, based on the actions of the Jiva; male or female bodies are obtained.</p>

          <p align="justify">[14] Now, I would explain the path of reaching higher abodes for the Jiva. Listen carefully!</p>

          <p align="justify">[15] One who possesses peaceful nature, pious qualities, also remains inclined towards the scriptures and righteousness, that one is taken upwards till Brahmaloka in celestial plane.</p>

          <p align="justify">[16] First attains to the abodes of sun and moon, after that a celestial deity descends and takes the Jiva to Brahmaloka.</p>

          <p align="justify">[17] In the abode of Brahma with the celestial body, the Jiva enjoys all his desires for a very long time. After staying there, one attains liberation along with the Brahma finally.</p>

          <p align="justify">[18] For a Jiva, who is devoid of wisdom and good deeds, certainly goes to hell. Such a Jiva experiences extreme torture in various hells and gains birth as a heinous creature like housefly, mosquito, etc. on the earth.</p>

          <p align="justify">[19] This is all about the condition of Jiva after death. Do you have any questions, Rama?</p>

          <p align="justify">[20] Rama questioned: O Lord! You have detailed out the enjoyments of the abodes of Brahma, Sun, and Moon based on the merits gained from knowledge and actions. However, I would like to know when I can enjoy the pleasures in still higher abodes? O consort of Parvati! Kindly explain.</p>

          <p align="justify">[21] Bhagavan said: O Rama! Merits are gained based on knowledge and actions.</p>

          <p align="justify">[22] For a young aged person, who looks fantastic, who is valorous, who is healthy without any diseases, who is strong, who rules over the seven continents without any problem; whatever amount of happiness such a person gains, that is termed as 'human happiness'.</p>

          <p align="justify">[23] When a person does severe penance, that person becomes a divine being. As a result, one gains a hundred times the human happiness.</p>

          <p align="justify">[24] In this way, every higher being gains a hundred times greater happiness than the previous one.</p>

          <p align="justify">[25] One who deliberately does good actions, that one gains fruits which would decline. One who doesn't expect any fruits of one's actions, such a sinless pious person gains eternal bliss.</p>

          <p align="justify">[26] Due to the high merits possessed by knowledge of soul, comforts in heaven become manifold. Therefore, there is nothing greater than self-knowledge to attain.</p>

          <p align="justify">[27] A devotee after enlightenment remains untouched with the sinful activities. Because of the attainment of knowledge, the devotee surpasses everything.</p>

          <p align="justify">[28] Whatever merit is obtained by giving food to one crore brahmins, such an equal merit lies in giving food to a self-realised being.</p>

          <p align="justify">[29] A person who shows hatred or repulsion towards an enlightened soul, that one dies a pathetic death.</p>

          <p align="justify">[30] A spiritual practitioner never lands in sorrow. Hence, O Rama! You too should follow the spiritual path.</p>
