          <h1 class="mt-4">GLORY OF SHIVA DEVOTION</h1><br>

          <p align="justify">[1] Sage Suta addressed his disciples: O Sages! By the grace of Lord Shiva, I am going to impart a very sacred and divine knowledge, which acts as a medicine for the world and takes us to our natural state known as 'Moksha' or liberation.</p>

          <p align="justify">[2] One cannot attain moksha by performing any kind of virtues, or by performing any kind of penances and religious rites. But, only through divine knowledge, the moksha can be achieved.</p>

          <p align="justify">[3] In olden days in 'Dandaka' forest whatever was preached by Lord Shiva to Rama is a divine secret, which when implemented in life would give liberation to human beings.</p>

          <p align="justify">[4] Shiva Gita was preached to 'Sanat Kumara' by 'Skanda'. Subsequently, Sanat Kumara preached the same to Sage Vyasa. That Sage out of compassion bestowed that knowledge to me.</p>

          <p align="justify">[5] Sage Suta further cautioned his disciples not to disclose this knowledge to anyone, else demigods of heaven would become angry and would curse.</p>

          <p align="justify">[6] Disciples enquired: What harm would demigods face if someone tells this Shiva Gita to others? Why would they become angry? Why would they curse?</p>

          <p align="justify">[7] Sage out of affection explained: A householder does sacrificial rites by dedicating food and beverages to the demigods through fire. The demigods accept these offerings with happiness, in return, they maintain timely rains and help the earth produce grains properly.</p>

          <p align="justify">[8] If the householders leave doing these fundamental duties to the demigods, and immerse themselves in 'Yoga' or union of individual soul with supreme soul, in learning about the supreme god and attain pleasure in serving the supreme lord through the path of knowledge or devotion, it makes demigods unhappy since they wouldn't get their share of food through sacrifices.</p>

          <p align="justify">[9] If someone manages to gain devotion for Lord Shiva, due to the disruption from the demigods, the devotion gets interrupted. That's why devotion for the supreme god doesn't take birth in everyone.</p>

          <p align="justify">[10] Disciples questioned: O Sage! If in this manner demigods of heaven keep obstructing humans from walking on the path of knowledge, how would humans attain liberation? For tenacious people is there any way to nullify the obstructions caused by demigods? If such an alternative exists to escape the disturbances from demigods, kindly preach that to us. To their questions, Sage answered in this way.</p>

          <p align="justify">[11] One gets devotion towards 'Maheshvara' or the supreme lord only if one has accumulated virtues over the past crores of births. Due to that devotion, one performs many tasks for the sake of humanity.</p>

          <p align="justify">[12] The devotees must remain detached from all their desires and should devote everything to Shiva. Due to that nature, the devotee would keep doing good deeds and would gain the grace of Lord Shiva. When one earns the grace of Lord Shiva, the demigods wouldn't dare to interrupt the devotion because of the fear of Lord's anger.</p>

          <p align="justify">[13] That's why humans should all the time remain immersed in the worship of Lord Shiva and hence, they would gain knowledge which gives the final liberation.</p>

          <p align="justify">[14] The devotee who keeps an unshakable faith in Lord Shiva, only that person would get saved from great sins and minor sins even if they are crores in number.</p>

          <p align="justify">[15] If someone while criticising, or while disrespecting, or even due to jealousy, gains devotion for Shiva, that person would get cleansed of all the sins eventually.</p>

          <p align="justify"><strong>NOTE:</strong> We have a real example of 'Daksha Prajapati' or the father of Sati, who was filled with hatred for Lord Shiva. His hatred for Shiva increased to such limits that he unknowingly used to think constantly of Shiva only. Finally, what happened we all know. He was given Salvation by the Lord through killing. Hence, even if inadvertently one develops slightest devotion towards Shiva, one would get cleansed of all the sins finally. The idea here is not to develop negative devotion, but it tells the glory of Shiva devotion.</p>

          <p align="justify">[16] One whose Shiva devotion becomes strong, such people would get all their desires fulfilled by it. But for those who are totally submitted to Shiva, would get liberated out of the birth rebirth cycle and would attain liberation.</p>

          <p align="justify">[17] One who is devoted to Shiva without doing any sins, with such a kind of devotee, the Lord would be highly pleased and would fulfil all wishes. One who dedicates the 'Bilva' leaves or water with full devotion, with that Lord can bestow the devotee with the empire of the three worlds.</p>

          <p align="justify">[18] One who is unable to worship Shiva as described above, if that person only offers 'Namaskara' or salutes to the Lord, Shiva would become very pleased.</p>

          <p align="justify">[19] Even to this simple thing as well, if people don't have time or are unable to do so, they can simply think of Lord Shiva from the same place wherever they are. With this insignificantly seeming prayer also, Lord would shower all the boons which the devotee is desirous of.</p>

          <p align="justify">[20] The sandalwood which is prepared from the wood of Bilva tree, flowers and fruits, if offered to 'Mahadeva' or the greatest god, Lord would be extremely pleased.</p>

          <p align="justify">[21] Lord Shiva likes the flowers and fruits born in the forest compared to the so-called better flowers of the villages.</p>

          <p align="justify">[22] If someone neglects the easily pleasing Lord Shiva and worships other deities, then it is like desiring for mirage water by leaving the holy river beside.</p>

          <p align="justify">[23] One who has accumulated a lot of vices, such a person wouldn't take interest in the supreme personality of godhead, Lord Shiva.</p>

          <p align="justify">[24] To do service to Lord Shiva, there is nothing like the right time or right place. Whatever time, whichever season, whichever place it might be, a person who meditates on Shiva with happiness, there is no doubt that such a pure hearted person would achieve liberation.</p>

          <p align="justify">[25] Even if someone is an incarnation of Shiva, if that person develops self-pride by thinking, "I am the Lord", such a person's life span would decline and also lineage would culminate. Hence, even if someone is a lord of the three worlds, one should remain free from ego and pride.</p>

          <p align="justify">[26] If one remains filled with the feeling of Lord's devotee, then the supreme Lord Shiva would get pleased and would make that person merge inside himself.</p>

          <p align="justify">[27] O Sages! I would narrate one great vow which bestows all the four goals of human life; 'Dharma', 'Artha', 'Kama' and 'Moksha'. That vow is called 'Viraja Diksha'. You all may take the initiation as per my instructions by applying holy ash, wearing 'Rudraksha' and chanting the thousand names of Shiva, which is a summary taken from all the four Vedas. If you follow this, you would leave your temporary human body and would attain divinity by gaining Shiva's form itself. Then the Lord who is auspicious for all the worlds would appear in front of you and give you liberation.</p>

          <p align="justify">[28] Long time ago, in the 'Dandaka' forest, Sri Rama had lost his wife. Hence, Sage Agastya preached this yoga discipline to him. The same I would preach entirely to you all. So, listen to me with full focus and devotion.</p>
