          <h1 class="mt-4">THE TEACHING OF DISPASSION</h1><br>

          <p align="justify">[1] Disciples questioned: O Sage! In what way did Sage Agastya initiate Rama in Viraja Diksha? Subsequently, what results did Rama get out of that? Kindly narrate the entire story to us in detail. After listening to their request, Sage Suta replied in this way.</p>

          <p align="justify">[2] When Sita, the wife of Sri Rama was abducted by Ravana, he was in a desperate mood due to his beloved separation.</p>

          <p align="justify">[3] He didn't sleep day and night; left eating food, and lost his valour, and together with his brother, Lakshmana, he almost became lifeless.</p>

          <p align="justify">[4] Having realised about Rama's condition, Sage Agastya, the consort of Lopamudra, came to Sri Rama's place. Thereafter, he taught Rama as follows.</p>

          <p align="justify">[5] Sage said: O Rama! Why are you feeling so sad? Think who is Sita. Ignorant person wouldn't understand this secret.</p>

          <p align="justify">[6] This body is made up of five elements. But the soul is unattached to the body and it is beyond the reach of birth and death. Also, the soul remains unaffected by sorrows.</p>

          <p align="justify">[7] Having a golden hue, a peach fruit kind of firm upraised breasts, a strawberry fruit kind of pink juicy lips, a face resembling a full moon, eyes resembling flowers, a slender waist, butter like soft skin, etc.</p>

          <p align="justify">[8] When a person gets trapped with such adjectives, such an ignorant one gets punished by Kamadeva, the demigod of lust.</p>

          <p align="justify">[9] Listen with attention! "Paramatma" or the supreme soul, is beyond gender attributes. God is neither male, nor female, nor hermaphrodite.</p>

          <p align="justify">[10] Lord Shiva is formless, omnipresent, a witness of everything, and is everything. The attractive body parts are nothing but a bag of excreta and urine.</p>

          <p align="justify">[11] O Rama! With your divine knowledge look at it once. That body which you are considering worthy of love and infatuation, is nothing but a bag of skin and flesh. That's full of disgusting materials and hence not worthy of loving or getting attached.</p>

          <p align="justify">[12] In all the bodies which are formed of five elements, the god is present as the soul.</p>

          <p align="justify">[13] When a house is built, the sky remains attached to it. However, when a house is burnt, it gets reduced to ashes, but it doesn't burn the sky at all. Similarly, the soul which resides inside the body doesn't perish while the bodies perish. </p>

          <p align="justify">[14] When one person beats another, one is seen as the punisher and another as the victim. But neither of them is the actual doer. Therefore, O Rama! It's worthless to doubt this fact. Realise your true self and be in everlasting bliss by leaving this sorrow. </p>

          <p align="justify">[15] Sri Rama said: O Saint! You discoursed that the soul doesn't suffer from agonies caused due to the body. In that case why is the pain of separation from Sita burning me? Whatever suffering is being experienced by me continuously, you said that's all illusion. How to believe those words?</p>

          <p align="justify">[16] The sorrow which torments a man, or the pleasure which pleases a man, that person is responsible but how come someone else is the doer? Kindly explain that in detail. </p>

          <p align="justify">[17] Sage said: Who can understand the 'Maya' or illusion of Maheshvara? This entire universe is deluded by the maya of that Maheshvara. Know that maya as 'Prakriti' or nature and that illusionist as Maheshvara, who is the form of truth and knowledge, eternal, imperishable, and the protector of all the worlds. Lord Shiva pervades the entire universe as manifest and unmanifest, living and nonliving.</p>

          <p align="justify">[18] The portion of Maheshvara lives in the hearts of all living beings as the soul, due to the accumulated past actions. </p>

          <p align="justify">[19] Those souls which are attached with age-old 'Vasana' or latent tendencies are called 'Kshetragya' or the one who knows the field of body and mind.</p>

          <p align="justify">[20] 'Manas' or the mind, 'Chitta' or the memory, 'Buddhi' or the intellect, and 'Ahankara' or the ego, these are called the four internal organs. In these as a shadow remains the soul and experiences the results of virtues and vices.</p>

          <p align="justify">[21] The body which desires for enjoyment exists in the various forms of living beings. That kind of body is of two types called immobile and mobile. Immobile bodies belong to trees, bushes, and creepers. Mobile bodies are those which are womb born, egg born, and sweat born. These are the three subcategories in which mobile bodies are classified.</p>

          <p align="justify">[22] The living entities according to past 'Karma' or actions obtains mobility or immobility. Whatever body the living entity gains, and all the pleasures and pains experienced by it are due to the maya of the supreme lord.</p>

          <p align="justify">[23] 'Kama' or the lust, 'Krodha' or the anger, 'Lobha' or the greed, 'Moha' or the attachment, 'Mada' or the pride and 'Matsarya' or the jealousy, are called the six enemies of the eternal soul.</p>

          <p align="justify">[24] The soul gets shackled with the aforementioned fetters in the state of ignorance. When it doesn't fall prey to those vices by gaining divine knowledge, it attains oneness with Shiva.</p>

          <p align="justify">[25] If the soul becomes a prey to maya, then it becomes the reason for its pleasures and pains.</p>

          <p align="justify">[26] When analysed through wisdom, these pleasures and pains would vanish, otherwise that's too stubborn to get eradicated. Therefore, O Rama! How do you become sorrowful for Sita? That's worthless to become sorrowful.</p>

          <p align="justify">[27] Rama said: O Sage! Whatever discourse you gave to me is indeed true. However, due to my past karma, the sadness which is burning me like fire is not getting extinguished.</p>

          <p align="justify">[28] The law of karma is tormenting me day and night. In this way if a being gets tortured then there are chances for this body to fall down. Hence, O foremost devotee of Shiva! Show me the right path. </p>
