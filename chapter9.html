          <h1 class="mt-4">DESCRIPTION OF THE BODY</h1><br>

          <p align="justify">[1] Bhagavan said: O Rama! Now I will explain to you the form of the gross bodies.</p>

          <p align="justify">[2] Listen carefully! This entire universe is being created from me. It's being protected by me and also this entire universe is getting dissolved in me. But still, I am pure, sinless, self-dependent, truth, bliss, consciousness and complete.</p>

          <p align="justify">[3] I am devoid of any duality, and devoid of ego, I'm the eternal self, and united with eternal ignorance.</p>

          <p align="justify">[4] Difficult to be defined in words, the great knowledge is composed of three qualities; Tamas, Rajas, and Sattva.</p>

          <p align="justify">[5] These three are the qualities of maya. Among these three, Sattva qualities are of white colour. It gives happiness and wisdom. Rajas quality is of red colour and it is fickle. It gives sorrow to humans. Tamas quality is of black colour and is immobile. It gives repulsion from good qualities.</p>

          <p align="justify">[6] This power of illusion consisting of the three qualities with my support assumes diverse forms within me.</p>

          <p align="justify">[7] Sky, Water, Earth, Fire, and Wind. These five elements are formed by maya and originate from me only.</p>

          <p align="justify">[8] This entire universe has originated from these five elements only. Even the bodies of creatures have been formed of the five elements.</p>

          <p align="justify">[9] This body is created from the food consumed by the parents. The tendons, bones and bone-marrow are derived from the father. The skin, flesh and blood are received from the mother.</p>

          <p align="justify">[10] In body formation at birth; complexion, growth, satisfaction, strength, detachment, enthusiasm are called the products of the intrinsic nature of the body. </p>

          <p align="justify">[11] Likes-dislikes, happiness-sorrow, prohibited acts, knowledge, life-span and the sense organs are the result of one's past actions.</p>

          <p align="justify">[12] The five sense organs are eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin. The five tanmatras are sight, sound, smell, taste and touch. The five organs of action are speech, hands, feet, sex-organ and anus.</p>

          <p align="justify">[13] Mind, Intellect, Memory and Ego are together called the four internal organs.</p>

          <p align="justify">[14] When consciousness is engaged in willing or doubting, it is called mind. When it is free from doubts and when it arrives at a conclusion, it is called intellect.</p>

          <p align="justify">[15] When consciousness is engaged in recollection of past events, it is called memory. Whereas when it identifies with the sense of 'I', it is called 'Ahankara' or ego.</p>

          <p align="justify">[16] From Sattva arises faith in god, controlled senses, cleanliness, inclination towards righteousness, etc. qualities. From Rajas arises lust, anger, greed, ego, etc. qualities. From Tamas arises sleep, binge, laziness, intoxication, etc. qualities.</p>

          <p align="justify">[17] Touch, skin, movements, expansions, contractions, and harshness are the properties of wind. Prana, Apana, Vyana, Udana, and Samana are the five major winds. Naga, Kurma, Krukura, Devadatta and Dhananjaya are five sub-winds.</p>

          <p align="justify">[18] Among the ten winds, the primary wind is Prana. It moves from navel to throat. Through the nostrils it gets in and moves through the heart and navel, it keeps circulating. This wind is one which supports speech, and intake outflow of air.</p>

          <p align="justify">[19] The next wind called Apana is located in anus, sex-organ, stomach, below navel, and thighs. It helps in excretion.</p>

          <p align="justify">[20] Eyes, ears, tongue and nostrils are the place of Vyana wind. It helps in Rechaka, Puraka, and Kumbhaka kind of pranayama activities.</p>

          <p align="justify">[21] Samana wind spreads the body heat all over the body through 72,000 nerve cells and keeps circulating. It balances the body's health by regulating the metabolism of the body after eating or drinking.</p>

          <p align="justify">[22] Udana wind remains in the feet, hands, and joints of the limbs, its primary functions are to lift the body and move the body parts.</p>

          <p align="justify">[23] Now coming to the sub-winds, their locations and functions; they remain spread throughout the body inside the skin, flesh, blood, bones, fats, and nerves.</p>

          <p align="justify">[24] Hiccups, vomiting, etc. functions are done by Naga wind. Closure and opening of eyelids, vision, etc. are the functions of Kurma wind. Hunger, thirst, sneezing, etc. are the functions of Krukura wind.</p>

          <p align="justify">[25] Laziness, sleep, etc. are the functions of Devadatta wind. Crying, laughing, etc. are the functions of Dhananjaya wind.</p>

          <p align="justify">[26] Intellect, serenity, aura, anger, strength, valour and power of digestion; all these are obtained from the fire element.</p>

          <p align="justify">[27] Now, from the water element; taste, tongue, friendship, coolness, fluids, sweat, softness, etc. are obtained.</p>

          <p align="justify">[28] From the earth element; smell, persistence, patience, weight, skin, flesh, blood, brain, bones, fats, semen, and nerves are obtained.</p>

          <p align="justify">[29] Food eaten by the creatures is divided into three parts by the fire of the belly. Among them, the gross portion becomes the excreta, the middle portion becomes the flesh, and the subtle portion becomes the mind. That's the reason why the mind is called a form of food.</p>

          <p align="justify">[30] Similarly, from water's gross portion urine is formed, the middle portion becomes the constituent of blood, and the subtle portion becomes the life force. That's the reason why life force is called a form of water.</p>

          <p align="justify">[31] Out of digested food comes blood. Out of blood comes flesh. Out of flesh comes fat. Out of fat comes bone. Out of bone comes marrow. Out of marrow comes semen. Also, out of flesh the brain gets formed.</p>

          <p align="justify">[32] In this body, blood of eight handful, excreta of seven handful, phlegm of six handful, bile of twenty handful, urine of three handful, flesh of two handful, fat of two handful, bone of one handful and semen of half handful quantity forms the body.</p>

          <p align="justify">[33] There are three hundred and sixty bones. However, there exist two hundred and ten joints in this human body. There are thirty-five million hairs on the head. Also, the hairs on the beard are three lakhs.</p>

          <p align="justify">[34] O Rama! I have explained to you the form of the body completely. In the three worlds, there is nothing more disgusting than the material body. Even the most exalted wise ones also commit sins due to the attachment with such a body.</p>

          <p align="justify">[35] Therefore, the wise ones should properly understand the reality of the material body in detail and discard their attachments with the body and get attached to the eternal self.</p>
