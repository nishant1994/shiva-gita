          <h1 class="mt-4">DESCRIPTION OF THE SOUL</h1><br>

          <p align="justify">[1] After knowing minute details about the gross material body, Rama enquired about the Jiva.</p>

          <p align="justify">[2] Rama said: O Bhagavan! In this versatile gross body, does the Jiva dwell inside in minute form? Does it take birth inside? How did it receive the name 'Jiva'?</p>

          <p align="justify">[3] Is the Jiva natural or is it bound by ignorance? What does the Jiva look like? Please explain everything to me in detail.</p>

          <p align="justify">[4] Bhagavan said: This concept is not known even to the demigods. Pleased with your devotion, I am explaining these secrets. Listen carefully! These secrets shouldn't be disclosed to undeserving ones.</p>

          <p align="justify">[5] Before knowing the form of the Jiva, one has to know the form of the Parameshvara in detail.</p>

          <p align="justify">[6] I am above all religions. I'm eternal, pure, the indweller in all beings and all forms are my forms.</p>

          <p align="justify">[7] I am beyond the comprehension of the mind, I'm beyond all senses, I comprehend everything, I know all the universes, but no one knows me. I am devoid of any action and result.</p>

          <p align="justify">[8] Incapable of describing me, the Vedas themselves become silent; such a supreme being I am and the one who knows me in this way wouldn't fear anything.</p>

          <p align="justify">[9] All creatures reside in me, hence a wise one who sees me in all creatures, such a one should not fear any creature.</p>

          <p align="justify">[10] One who understands the fact that all creatures are not different from me, how can such a person ever get immersed in sorrow?</p>

          <p align="justify">[11] Paramatma resides in all creatures in secrecy and stays invisible. A yogi who sees with a micro vision of yoga, to such a wise one only this Paramatma would be visible.</p>

          <p align="justify">[12] Devoid of caste and creeds, devoid of mine and your feelings, I am the ancient one. But covering myself through ignorance in the form of Brahma, I am becoming the creator.</p>

          <p align="justify">[13] In the dream state, the three worlds due to ignorance appear as being created. Those worlds appear inside me, stay in me and vanish in me. All this creation is just my projection.</p>

          <p align="justify">[14] Under the blanket of ignorance, I only remain as Jiva. The Jiva is actually unborn. The true liberation is nothing but the destruction of this ignorance.</p>

          <p align="justify">[15] There exists a subtle body inside the gross body. In order to enjoy the fruits of virtues and vices, this subtle body remains in the gross body in a very minute form. Subtle body is composed of five sense organs, five organs of action, five major winds, mind, intellect, ego, and memory. With these nineteen elements put together, form the subtle body.</p>

          <p align="justify">[16] In the subtle body under the blanket of ignorance, the supreme Shiva resides and is called Kshetragya. It is the one who enjoys the fruits of good and bad deeds eternally as Jiva.</p>

          <p align="justify">[17] Jiva plays in the waking, dreaming, and sleeping states of consciousness and enjoys the fruits of good and bad actions.</p>

          <p align="justify">[18] If there is a sin in the internal organs, the soul appears to be the sinner. As if the mirror is dirty, when seen in that mirror, the face of a person looks dirty. Hence, residing under ignorance as Jiva, the soul also appears as enjoying the fruits of actions. But the soul is untouched in reality.</p>

          <p align="justify">[19] To the ignorant, it looks like the sinless soul also gets soiled in the actions and their results.</p>

          <p align="justify">[20] In the gross body, from head to toe, Jiva pervades and remains seated in the heart's core.</p>

          <p align="justify">[21] Listen carefully! Inside the heart, there exists a microscopic nerve called Sushumna. That is the dwelling place of the Jiva.</p>

          <p align="justify">[22] The nerves from the heart are seventy-two thousand in number. Out of them only hundred-one are primary ones, which spread outwards all over the body originating from the heart as like the rays of the sun.</p>

          <p align="justify">[23] The nerves help in the enjoyment of fruits from acts done in three states of consciousness and hence from every sense organ, they are connected in a group of ten and spread.</p>

          <p align="justify">[24] The way rivers remain full of water; these nerves remain full of the fruits of actions.</p>

          <p align="justify">[25] Among these hundred-one nerves, one nerve spans without break till the top of the head. Through that nerve, the Jiva leaves the gross body at the time of death.</p>

          <p align="justify">[26] 'Rahu' planet, despite being invisible becomes visible as it grasps the moon, in the same way the omnipresent soul becomes visible when connected through the subtle body.</p>

          <p align="justify">[27] As the infinite sky looks being captured inside pots separately, similarly the one soul which is all pervading looks separately established inside the bodies of all creatures.</p>

          <p align="justify">[28] Based on the actions performed in the different states of consciousness, to enjoy the results of the actions originating from the subtle body, the sensations move through the nerves.</p>

          <p align="justify">[29] By divine knowledge, when the subtle body which is blanketed by ignorance gets destroyed, that state of true liberation is achieved.</p>

          <p align="justify">[30] As a pot containing space inside when it gets destroyed, the space inside the pot becomes one with the infinite sky outside. In the same way, when ignorance gets destroyed with divine knowledge, Jiva becomes one with the supreme soul.</p>

          <p align="justify">[31] In the wakeful state, when the enjoyment of actions declines, moving away from the gross body, it reaches the dream state with the desire of enjoying the actions there, in this way the Jiva transitions from one state to another.</p>

          <p align="justify">[32] Jiva always remains entangled with some desires, but the self-illuminating consciousness remains untouched with them.</p>

          <p align="justify">[33] Due to the desires in internal organs, Jiva becomes bound. This entire universe based on action gets projected because of desires only.</p>

          <p align="justify">[34] Like the wakeful state, in the dream state also, this Jiva appears as the doer of the actions because of desires. The soul remains as the witness of all as self-illuminating power. </p>

          <p align="justify">[35] In the infancy whatever acts happen, they happen due to the results of the previous birth's actions. Sometimes these past births appear in dreams as well.</p>

          <p align="justify">[36] As a result of devotion, one who desires to enjoy the bliss of the upper worlds, sees one's future births in the dreams.</p>

          <p align="justify">[37] The one who has been running aimlessly through life, becomes tired from the world. They try to become one with the god through yoga by controlling their senses.</p>

          <p align="justify">[38] Jiva merges with the Ishvara through the Sushumna nerve by contracting all the desires and actions into oneself. At that moment, one experiences a supreme bliss, which remains above all these insignificant worldly pleasures.</p>

          <p align="justify">[39] The way a sexually aroused person forgets all the outward senses and remains in extreme bliss of orgasm during the activity, in the same way, Jiva after obtaining the supreme state remains in the infinite bliss.</p>

          <p align="justify">[40] Due to becoming one as the witness and devoid of outside feelings in the deep sleep, one feels very blissful after waking up. In this world, the three states of consciousness appear again and again. After waking up, the mind, intellect, memory and ego originate from the causal body, and through the subtle body, spreads all over the gross body.</p>

          <p align="justify">[41] The pot when immersed in water and left on its own, pops out of water automatically, in the same way, Jiva comes back to the gross body from the causal body on its own after waking up.</p>

          <p align="justify">[42] The sun having one appearance looks differently in various vessels, in the same way that one Paramatma, appears differently in various forms.</p>

          <p align="justify">[43] O Rama! This explains the concept of Jiva. Now, I'll tell you the details of the after-death states. Listen carefully!</p>
