          <h1 class="mt-4">BOON BESTOWAL TO RAMA</h1><br>

          <p align="justify">[1] Sage Suta said: Sri Rama sighted a divine chariot shining with exaggerated brilliance due to gems and diamonds, which has four wheels, covered with pearl garlands, having celestial umbrellas, had a flag bearing the banner of Nandi the bull, had decoration made of 'Parijata' flowers, and there were sighted numerous beings seated on that chariot playing various musical instruments and singing.</p>

          <p align="justify">[2] Lord Shiva, having created such a celestial chariot, climbed down from vehicle Nandi and stepped up that chariot and sat on the throne.</p>

          <p align="justify">[3] The Lord of Parvati comfortably sat there enjoying the comfort obtained by the breeze produced by the hand fans operated by the celestial maids and goddesses.</p>

          <p align="justify">[4] Thereafter, Lord Shiva donated to Sri Rama the supreme weapon by the name 'Mahapashupatastra'.</p>

          <p align="justify">[5] Mahadeva said: O Rama! This weapon is supremely terrible which when hurled can annihilate the entire universe. Therefore, do not hurl this devastating weapon in battles of lesser scale.</p>

          <p align="justify">[6] There is no one in the entire three worlds who can counter this weapon and remain alive. Therefore, this weapon needs to be hurled only if it's a matter of protection of dharma and there is no other way around. If this rule is broken in any way, there would be total annihilation of the universe.</p>

          <p align="justify">[7] After that Lord Shiva drew the attention of all demigods and addressed them: O Immortals! Give your respective personal weapons to Rama. He would use them to slay Ravana. For whatever reason I had given the boon to Ravana of being undefeatable by the demigods, for the same reason I had asked you all to take birth as forest dwelling 'Vanaras' or the monkey men.</p>

          <p align="justify">[8] You all in the form of vanaras should help Rama in his mission and later you can come back to your respective abodes. Following the orders of Lord Shiva, with joined hands, all the deities donated their personal weapons to Rama as follows.</p>

          <p align="justify">[9] Narayana donated his Narayanastra, Brahma gave his Brahmastra, Indra gave his Indrastra, Yama gave his Yamastra, Kama gave his Kamastra, Varuna gave his Varunastra, Rudra donated his Roudrastra, Surya donated his Suryastra, and Chandra gave his Soumyastra.</p>

          <p align="justify">[10] Thereafter, Sri Rama became satisfied and saluted Lord Shiva time and again. Further, with full devotion Rama spoke the following words: O Parameshwara! The vast and deep ocean is impossible to be crossed by humans.</p>

          <p align="justify">[11] Moreover, Lanka fort is impregnable for even demigods and demons. There many saints, devotees, wise men, illusionists, and many other high profiled people exist. How would it be possible for me and my younger brother Lakshmana to defeat Ravana?</p>

          <p align="justify">[12] Lord said: O Brave Rama! Do not worry on that front. Ravana's time has started nearing its end. All those demons have become unrighteous, and have tormented demigods and devotees. Therefore, their lifespan and all opulence are destined to come to an end.</p>

          <p align="justify">[13] That Ravana who has abducted the wife of a king, to such a demon you would be able to slay in the battle, the way it is easy to vanquish a drunken man.</p>

          <p align="justify">[14] What if Ravana is a master in Vedas? What if he was a righteous person before? When the time to decline arises, one becomes the enemy of one's own intellect and acts against righteousness. Unrighteous enemies come our way only due to good fortune.</p>

          <p align="justify">[15] O Rama! In the city called 'Kishkindha', many forest dwelling vanaras exist who are born from the portion of demigods. They all are skilled and possessors of strength. They would help you cross the ocean and would assist you in every possible way.</p>

          <p align="justify">[16] Those vanaras would create a bridge over the ocean by using huge rocks and stones, and would cross the ocean along with you. You use their forces in slaying Ravana and bring your beloved back.</p>

          <p align="justify">[17] When the enemy is fleeing away, or when the enemy is devoid of weapons, or when the enemy has limited weapons; on such types of enemies, one should not hurl the supreme weapons. If hurled, then the wielder would be destroyed. Hence, always remember to not use the divine weapons on aforementioned categories of enemies.</p>

          <p align="justify">[18] This entire universe has been created by me, has been protected by me and by me only it would be destroyed. It is I, who is the death of even death. It is me who swallows the entire mobile and immobile creation at the end of time.</p>

          <p align="justify">[19] All those demons who would die in this fierce battle, all have been swallowed by me in reality. You are just an instrument, and you would gain immense and eternal glory.</p>
