          <h1 class="mt-4">THE GLORY OF GOD</h1><br>

          <p align="justify">[1] Sri Rama enquired: O Mahadeva! I am confused with the statements that you made recently.</p>

          <p align="justify">[2] How do you create this entire universe when you are seated here with your consort Parvati along with your servants? Kindly explain in detail and enlighten me.</p>

          <p align="justify">[3] Sri Bhagavan said: O Rama! Very wisely, you have asked a significant question indeed.</p>

          <p align="justify">[4] The answer to this is not known to the very demigods. Therefore, I would detail out to you the secret information, Listen carefully!</p>

          <p align="justify">[5] All these visible five elements, fourteen worlds, seven oceans, all demigods and demons, sages, entire mobile and immobile creation, everything has manifested from my portion only.</p>

          <p align="justify">[6] At first, all demigods desired to know my true form. Knowing their desire, out of a playful mood, I had stolen away their knowledge. Thus, when I appeared, under the stupor of ignorance, they questioned me, 'Who are you?'.</p>

          <p align="justify">[7] In that context, I addressed them: O Deities! I am the oldest primordial being. Know that in this entire universe, there is none other than me. I am the nondual one.</p>

          <p align="justify">[8] I am the oldest. I'm the one who is eternal and I'm the non-eternal too, I'm the one who is sinless.</p>

          <p align="justify">[9] I am all the directions. All these males, females and hermaphrodites also are me.</p>

          <p align="justify">[10] I am the one known through Vedas, I'm the truth, I'm the peace, and I'm Bhagavan. I am the supreme light.</p>

          <p align="justify">[11] I am in the hymns of upanishads, I'm mantra, and I am the sacrificial offerings, I'm the donor and the donation.</p>

          <p align="justify">[12] I am the material world where 'Jiva' or individual soul takes birth and also, I'm the world where it goes after death, I'm imperishable and I'm perishable too.</p>

          <p align="justify">[13] I am the one having faces everywhere. I'm the beginning, middle, and the end, I'm outside and inside, I'm the front and back as well.</p>

          <p align="justify">[14] I am light and also, I'm darkness, I'm the sense organs and the mind as well.</p>

          <p align="justify">[15] I am Brahma, I'm Vishnu and I'm Maheshvara, also I'm Sarasvati, I'm Lakshmi and I'm Parvati as well.</p>

          <p align="justify">[16] I am Skanda and I'm Vinayaka, also I'm Indra, I'm Kama and Yama also. I am from the fourteen worlds.</p>

          <p align="justify">[17] I am sun, I'm moon, I'm stars and planets as well. I am all the creatures, also I'm the life force inside them.</p>

          <p align="justify">[18] I am the time, death, and eternity. I'm the past, present and future. I'm everything indeed.</p>

          <p align="justify">[19] In the beginning as Omkara, in the middle as Bhur Bhuva Svaha worlds, and in the end as the cosmic form, I alone am.</p>

          <p align="justify">[20] I am the fruit of 'Japa' or meditative repetition. I'm all edible and drinkable items. I'm doable and non-doable things.</p>

          <p align="justify">[21] I am the supreme and I'm the non-supreme as well. I'm the well-being of the universe. I am the one who withdraws the entire creation into myself at the end of time.</p>

          <p align="justify">[22] The one whose head is towards north and whose feet remain towards south, such a supreme one, and the 'Pranava'of three syllables (A, U, M) is none other than me.</p>

          <p align="justify">[23] I deliver devotees from sins and give them upper regions, and I send the sinners to hell. Hence, I'm the everlasting one.</p>

          <p align="justify">[24] I am in the form of Omkara. I'm the Rig, Yajur, Sama, and Atharva Vedas as well.</p>

          <p align="justify">[25] The way flesh is an integral part of all creatures. Similarly, the whole universe is an integral part of me. Hence, I'm called the indweller of all.</p>

          <p align="justify">[26] Since Brahma and Vishnu failed to locate my ends, I am called to be infinite. I remain invisible to the eyes in all the bodies. Hence, I am called subtle.</p>

          <p align="justify">[27] I ferry my devotees from birth, disease, ageing, and death, also liberate them from the ocean of world altogether. Therefore, I am called the ferryman.</p>

          <p align="justify">[28] To the ones who are immersed in the darkness of ignorance, I show them the desire for knowledge and liberation like an electric spark. Hence, I am called to be the form of lightning.</p>

          <p align="justify">[29] Because I alone create universes, I alone sustain them, and again I alone take them back into myself. Hence, I am called the Lord.</p>

          <p align="justify">[30] There is none who is second to me. I alone dissolve all creatures within my heart. Hence, I am called Rudra.</p>

          <p align="justify">[31] I am omniscient and at the same time, I remain as the means to know this entire universe. Therefore, I am called the eyes of the world.</p>

          <p align="justify">[32] Because I am the lord of all creatures and all knowledge. Hence, I am called the prosperous one.</p>

          <p align="justify">[33] Because I witness all feelings, all knowledge in time through yoga. Hence, I am called Bhagavan.</p>

          <p align="justify">[34] I create and support all the worlds in me, also I discard those worlds. Hence, I am called Maheshvara.</p>

          <p align="justify">[35] I am the lord who is born within space and time, I'm the one being born, I'm the one who is still inside the womb, I'm the old aged one, and I am the one who has faces everywhere. I am the protector of all the worlds.</p>

          <p align="justify">[36] All faces are my faces, all eyes are my eyes, all limbs are my limbs. I am the creator of all kinds of worlds.</p>

          <p align="justify">[37] Moreover, people who realise me as the one dwelling in the hearts of all beings as divine light; such a kind of Jiva only can attain permanent peace called liberation.</p>

          <p align="justify">[38] I alone remain as the cause behind the creation and dwell as the inner soul of all. In this way, one who knows me as Ishvara, and enquires into me; such a one gains liberation.</p>

          <p align="justify">[39] The vital force which is the cause of all sensations like hunger and thirst is also I alone. One who meditates on me and worships me, only that person gains eternal peace.</p>

          <p align="justify">[40] The wise who realises me as the eternal self never fears anything.</p>

          <p align="justify">[41] In this way, the demigods listened to my words and realised the path towards liberation, and thereafter they remained devoted to me through Japa of my names, through meditation and at the end of their lifespan they merged in me.</p>

          <p align="justify">[42] That's why whatever things are visible to your eyes, all those are my forms only. Everything takes birth in me, in me only everything survives and in me only everything gets dissolved at the end.</p>

          <p align="justify">[43] I remain in atomic form in micro elements and I remain in gross form in macro elements, I'm eternal, I am Shiva.</p>

          <p align="justify">[44] I have no hands but I can grasp everything, I do not have eyes but I see everything, devoid of ears I hear everything.</p>

          <p align="justify">[45] I am the knower of everything. However, there is no one who knows me in reality.</p>

          <p align="justify">[46] I am the one to be known through all the Vedas. Also, I am the creator of the Vedas and Vedanta.</p>

          <p align="justify">[47] O Rama! I am beyond the five elements. I am beyond birth and death. I am beyond virtues and vices. There is no end to me.</p>
