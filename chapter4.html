          <h1 class="mt-4">THE THEOPHANY OF SHIVA</h1><br>

          <p align="justify">[1] Sage Suta said to his disciples: In this way Sage Agastya initiated Sri Rama and went back to his hermitage.</p>

          <p align="justify">[2] Near to the bank of a sacred river, Sri Rama established a Shivalinga on a hilltop, and in the prescribed manner he underwent the Viraja Diksha.</p>

          <p align="justify">[3] He smeared all his body parts with holy ash in a three horizontal lined fashion, and worshipped the Lord with forest flowers and fruits, being seated on the tiger skin.</p>

          <p align="justify">[4] He started chanting the thousand names of Shiva, day and night. This way he spent one month eating only fruits, next month he lived by eating leaves only, the following month he sustained himself only on water, and last month he survived only by consuming air. In this way, Rama spent four months of the Viraja Diksha austerity. </p>

          <p align="justify">[5] He remained pious and maintained all virtuous qualities; tranquillity, control of the senses, contentment, endurance, faith and a burning desire for liberation.</p>

          <p align="justify">[6] With a cleansed heart, he meditated on Lord Maheshvara who resides in the heart, also who is higher than the highest.</p>

          <p align="justify">[7] Lord Shiva is of the form 'Ardhanareeswara', who has four hands and three eyes, who is like lightning flash of red colour, who has matted hair, who has an aura which equals the brilliance of crores of suns, whose aura is as cool as the coolness of crores of moons combined, who wears snake as a sacred thread, who wears tiger skin as garments, who keeps one hand in blessing posture, who is worshipped by all demigods and demons, who has five faces, who wears a crescent moon on the head, who holds a 'Damaru' and a trident, who is eternal, sinless and imperishable.</p>

          <p align="justify">[8] One fine day, Rama heard a terrible and fear striking sound which resembled the roars of oceans as made during the time of cosmic dissolution, which resembled the terrible sound made by the arrow of 'Rudra' or the fierce one, when shot while destroying the three cities.</p>

          <p align="justify">[9] Rama, startled with fear, looked around in all directions. He beheld a huge brilliance spread all around.</p>

          <p align="justify">[10] Due to that high intensity brilliance, for a second Rama felt as if he went blind and couldn't see anything apart from light. He thought all that was probably the illusion of some demons. Thereafter, he stood up holding the bow in his hands and projected many divine arrows in the air through the power of mantra.</p>

          <p align="justify">[11] Whatever arrows Rama projected in that brilliant light, all those vanished as if ice cubes melted in an ocean.</p>

          <p align="justify">[12] In another few seconds, Rama's bow fell down on its own and got reduced to ashes. Also, his hand shield and other accessories too fell down and got incinerated.</p>

          <p align="justify">[13] Seeing all these disasters happening around, his brother, Lakshmana, trembled and fell down unconscious.</p>

          <p align="justify">[14] After that Rama in a confused state unable to think of anything, knelt down on the ground with fear, closed his eyes and thought that only Lord Shiva would be capable of protecting him. With a raised voice, he chanted the thousand names of Shiva while offering prostrations intermittently.</p>

          <p align="justify">[15] In a while, Rama heard the same fearsome sound echoing in all directions. Earth also trembled due to that terrible noise. Then within a split-second, Rama observed a cool moonshine everywhere.</p>

          <p align="justify">[16] Before Rama could understand what it was, he saw somebody who was as white as the cream obtained during the churning of milk, who had a gold ornamented tail, who had a pair of horns decked with diamonds, who had blue gems kind of eyes, who had an elegant cover on its back, who had a gem decked rope around the neck, and who was renting the skies with the sweet jingling noise of the bells present on his body. Rama beheld in front of him the great bull, Nandi.</p>

          <p align="justify">[17] Seated on the divine bull, was seen a lord as pure as crystal in complexion, who was blazing with a divine aura equal to billions of suns, whose brilliance was as soothing as light from billions of moons, who had tiger skin on his body as garments, who had a snake wrapped around his body as the sacred thread, who was decorated with many divine ornaments, who was blazing like lightning, who had moon on his crown, who had ten hands wielding various weapons, who looked very youthful. Rama beheld that blue necked, supreme lord, the one and only Lord Shiva. </p>

          <p align="justify">[18] Also, beside Shiva he beheld a goddess seated blissfully in 'Sukhasana' posture having a beautiful face, who was shining with a hue of bluish coloured diamonds, who was decorated with pearls and variety of gems, who wore divine garments and nicely smelling flower garlands, who had eyes resembling flowers. Rama sighted the mother of all the gods and goddesses, Parvati.</p>

          <p align="justify">[19] Then Sri Rama sighted in front of Shiva, the Lord Vishnu who held discus, conch, mace, and sword in his hands, who was shining brilliantly with a dark bluish hue, who was seated on his divine vehicle Eagle with his consort goddess Lakshmi and who was singing Sri Rudra hymn.</p>

          <p align="justify">[20] Thereafter, Rama sighted at the back side of Shiva, the Lord Brahma riding on his divine vehicle Swan, seated with his consort goddess Sarasvati and who was singing Rudra Suktas from four Vedas through his four heads.</p>

          <p align="justify">[21] Rama beheld many divine sages chanting 'Tryambakam' mantra. He also sighted the demigod of the ocean singing Atharvasiras hymns in the praise of Lord Shiva.</p>

          <p align="justify">[22] Also, the divine serpents were sighted singing hymns from Kaivalya upanishad in praise of Mahadeva.</p>

          <p align="justify">[23] Lord Vighneshwara, also known as Ganesha, was seated on a mouse and was as huge as a mountain towards the southern direction of Mahadeva. Towards the northern direction, the six faced Lord Skanda, also known as Karttikeya, was seen seated on a peacock.</p>

          <p align="justify">[24] Further, towards the left and right sides of Shiva, was seen Mahakala and Chandeshwara and at some distance was sighted the great blazing deity of dissolution Rudra. In the front side was beheld the three-legged Bhringi dancing along with other Ganas of diversely looking faces.</p>

          <p align="justify">[25] All around many divine beings were seen seated on their respective vehicles and chanting 'Panchakshari' mantra.</p>

          <p align="justify">[26] Seeing this beautiful scene, there were no limits to Sri Rama's ecstasy and bliss. Filled with boundless happiness, he started chanting the thousand names of Shiva.</p>
