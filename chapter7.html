          <h1 class="mt-4">VISION OF COSMIC FORM</h1><br>

          <p align="justify">[1] Sri Rama said: O Lord! Until now I didn't get clarification on my root doubt. How are all these creatures originating from your visible body of limited dimensions? How are they surviving? And again, how are they getting dissolved in you?</p>

          <p align="justify">[2] O Lord! How are you present in the form of demigods doing their respective duties and how are you in the form of these vast fourteen worlds? Kindly clarify this to me.</p>

          <p align="justify">[3] This has already been said by you, but I am not able to get clarity on this subject. Hence, I have this doubt, and you alone are capable of clarifying my doubt. </p>

          <p align="justify">[4] Bhagavan said: O Rama! As inside a small banyan seed, a giant banyan tree resides. When the right time comes, from that seed's core a huge banyan tree comes outside. Similarly, the entire creation and creatures emerge from my body. And at the end of time, they again enter inside me only.</p>

          <p align="justify">[5] Sri Rama said: O Mahadeva! In whatever number of ways or through whatever examples you tried to explain to me this concept; like a confused person who fails to discern, I am not able to understand that properly. What should I do now?</p>

          <p align="justify">[6] Bhagavan said: O Rama! This entire mobile and immobile creation dwells inside my belly. You do not have enough strength and capability to witness that scene.</p>

          <p align="justify">[7] With these eyes of flesh, neither humans nor demigods can ever be able to see my brilliant cosmic form. Therefore, I am giving you divine sight. Do not fear and properly see my divine cosmic form.</p>

          <p align="justify">[8] Sage Suta said: In this way spoke Lord Shiva and blessed Rama with the divine eye or the third eye.</p>

          <p align="justify">[9] Thereafter, Lord Shiva showed Rama by opening his mouth which was as wide as Patalaloka and blazing with billions of lightning strikes. Seeing such a dreadful scene, Rama trembled with fear and collapsed on the ground. </p>

          <p align="justify">[10] He prostrated on the ground and numerous times he prayed to Lord Shiva. Then that mighty armed hero gaining some strength again looked at the cosmic form of god, the destroyer of the three cities. </p>

          <p align="justify">[11] He sighted billions of universes like the groundnuts being roasted in blazing fires.</p>

          <p align="justify">[12] He saw inside the mouth; giant mountains, dense forests, seven great oceans, sun, moon and planets.</p>

          <p align="justify">[13] He witnessed the fourteen worlds; in every universe witnessed the battle of demigods and demons going on, and their cause and effects.</p>

          <p align="justify">[14] He also witnessed the ten primary incarnations of Lord Vishnu and their roles. He witnessed the event of destruction of the three cities by Shiva.</p>

          <p align="justify">[15] He saw all the creatures who are yet to be born, which were born in the past and which were being born.</p>

          <p align="justify">[16] He further saw the destruction of all these creations. Seeing that horrifying scene, Rama despite being a wise man, trembled with fear and saluted Lord Shiva again and again.</p>

          <p align="justify">[17] Then Rama sang the essence of all upanishads as a hymn in praise of Lord Shiva.</p>

          <p align="justify">[18] O Mahadeva! O lord of the universe! O lord who takes away sufferings! O 'Chandramouli' or wearer of the crescent moon! Kindly be pleased with me. I am like an orphan now, please protect me from the fears of the world.</p>

          <p align="justify">[19] O Ishvara! As trees take birth, reside and die on the earth; in the same way these entire universes took birth from you, reside in you and O Shiva! they get dissolved in you alone.</p>

          <p align="justify">[20] O 'Trishuldhari' or trident holder! Brahma,Vishnu, Indra, Yama, Demons; all mighty river groups; seven great oceans; all reside inside your face.</p>

          <p align="justify">[21] O 'Nilakantha' or blue necked one! All the universes take birth under your supreme power of maya.</p>

          <p align="justify">[22] A small particle can't support a huge object. However, inside your mouth, I see that the entire creation is supported. This is all your maya.</p>

          <p align="justify">[23] You are the indweller of everyone, also you are of the form of existence, consciousness and bliss.</p>

          <p align="justify">[24] O 'Tripurari' or destroyer of three cities! What is usually heard is that you bestow good results to those who please you through great tasks, but this also has become totally false now. Since, there is nothing that is different from you.</p>

          <p align="justify">[25] Ignorant saints preach that you become pleased with worship and various offerings because of their poor intellect. Since you don't have a form, what is the use of comforts and enjoyments to you?</p>

          <p align="justify"><strong>NOTE:</strong> After seeing the cosmic form of Lord Shiva, Rama got filled with Vedantic knowledge. Hence this statement got issued out of his mouth. But in reality, Rama and the saints both are correct. There are two levels of reality; absolute and relative. Absolute reality is the final truth, whereas relative reality is the tangible world. The entire creation is just an illusion, there is nothing that is different from Shiva. So, in this absolute sense, it is true that making any offerings to Shiva is stupidity. But we still live in this universe created by maya. Hence, we all live in relative reality. Only after gaining self-realisation, one gains the insight of the absolute reality. Therefore, the Lord is not stone hearted to not accept anything offered with love. If being a devotee with love and affection we offer anything, Shiva would definitely get pleased. 'Kannappa' who was a hunter, out of pure devotion thinking that Shiva might be hungry, in order to fill Lord's stomach, he offered meat of swine and Shiva gladly accepted it. Here the Lord doesn't measure how much divine knowledge one has. Shiva rates that person based on the extent of love one possesses for the Lord. There are various paths to reach Shiva, out of them, devotion and knowledge are the two important ones. The path of devotion dwells in relative reality, whereas the path of knowledge dwells in absolute reality. But, finally both lead to Shiva. Hence what sages said is not out of ignorance, but they spoke in a relative sense. What Rama realised is completely a fact in absolute sense, hence Rama is also correct in his place. Therefore, the conclusion is that both Rama and Saints are correct in their respective point of views, and the readers may choose any path; devotion or knowledge based on their inclination.</p>

          <p align="justify">[26] You are the primordial being who alone remains pervading in all directions and the entire world. Even when the complete world gets destroyed, you remain indestructible pervading like the emptiness.</p>

          <p align="justify">[27] As a single sun looks multiple when seen in multiple pots filled with water, in the same way you are the only one who exists, but you appear as many to the eyes.</p>

          <p align="justify">[28] There is no special benefit for you in doing creation, sustenance and dissolution of these universes. You make them originate, stay and dissolve in you, like a play in the dream.</p>

          <p align="justify">[29] O Tripurari! There is not even the slightest difference between you and the gross, the subtle and the causal bodies of Jiva, that's the reason why Vedas proclaim that the cause of all happiness and sorrow is you alone.</p>

          <p align="justify">[30] O Mahadeva! O Nilakantha! O destroyer of sins! In the import export business of the three bodies which are untrue in reality, you remain as the enjoyer of the fruits.</p>

          <p align="justify">[31] O Maheshvara! Kindly withdraw your cosmic form now. I have witnessed oneness of the entire universe by your grace.</p>

          <p align="justify">[32] Bhagavan said: O Rama! See my cosmic form carefully! There is none who exists other than me.</p>

          <p align="justify">[33] Sage Suta said: After instructing Rama in this way, Lord Shiva withdrew his cosmic form.</p>

          <p align="justify">[34] After that Sri Rama became extremely satisfied and within the split second of his eyes closing and opening the eyes, he beheld in front of him sitting in the tiger kind of yogic posture on the hill, the three eyed, five faced, blue necked, Lord Shiva who wore tiger skin as garments, who had ash smeared on all over his body who had matted hair, who had a crescent moon on the head, whose one hand was in blessing posture, who is the one leader of the entire world. Such a Mahadeva was seen by Rama once again.</p>

          <p align="justify">[35] Then Rama saluted him once again and with permission from Lord Shiva, he sat in front of him.</p>

          <p align="justify">[36] Bhagavan said: O Rama! Whatever other topics you have questions and want to get clarified from me; you may ask. There is no better guru than me to clarify your doubts.</p>
