          <h1 class="mt-4">EMBRYO ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT</h1><br>

          <p align="justify">[1] Sri Rama enquired: How is the body made up of five elements getting created? How is it sustained and how is it destroyed? Please explain it in detail.</p>

          <p align="justify">[2] Bhagavan replied: This gross body is formed of five elements; out of them the primary constituent is earth. This body is of four types based on the way they are created.</p>

          <p align="justify">[3] Humans and animals are called womb born. Birds, snakes, etc. creatures are called egg born. Insects, mosquitoes, etc. are called sweat born. Trees, plants, etc. are called earth born.</p>

          <p align="justify">[4] Listen! The body formed by the union of sperm or male seed and egg or female seed, is known as womb born.</p>

          <p align="justify">[5] When the sperm enters a woman's womb and unites with her egg during the fertility period, it creates a womb born body. If sperm becomes excess a male child is born. If the egg becomes excess, a female child is born.</p>

          <p align="justify">[6] Starting from the menses period of a female, for the next sixteen days is called the fertility period. During this period starting from the fifth day on any odd numbered days (5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15) if she unites with her husband, a female child would be born. If a female unites with her husband from the fourth day of menses on any even numbered day (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16) she would give birth to a male child.</p>

          <p align="justify">[7] If a woman gets impregnated on her fourth day of fertility period, whichever man's face the lady stares with desire, her offspring would carry that man's characteristics. That's why on the fourth day of the menses cycle, a woman should only look at her husband's face. This is the reason why scholars prohibit copulation on the fourth day. As per the scriptures, if impregnation done on the fifth day, it produces a girl child with good character, sixth day gives a son with good character, seventh and eighth days give a daughter and son respectively who would be very rich, ninth and tenth days would give a daughter and son respectively who would remain highly pious and sacred, eleventh day would produce a highly beautiful daughter, twelfth day would bestow a son with a long lifespan, thirteenth day would produce a prostitute kind of daughter, fourteenth day would produce a son with good qualities, fifteenth day would bless with a daughter who would be righteous and spiritual, sixteenth day would bless with a son who would be wise, long lived, rich and royal. These are the detailed rules of uniting during the fertility period of sixteen days.</p>

          <p align="justify">[8] After these sixteen days, uniting with the wife would be useless. Hence a person who unites with his wedded wife only during her fertility period of sixteen days and after that if he abstains from copulation, then such a man is called as a 'Brahmachari' or celibate by scriptures. Hence, even a householder can be called a celibate if one follows the aforementioned rules strictly.</p>

          <p align="justify">[9] The skin bag or covering present inside the woman's womb is called the uterus. Because of the union of sperm and egg, the foetus gets formed inside. Therefore, creatures taking birth from that are called womb born.</p>

          <p align="justify">[10] The sperm which enters the vagina of a woman mixes with the fluids there and remains in a fluid state in the first month. In the second month, it gains the shape of a bag after getting solidified. In the third month, hands, feet, head, etc. organs are formed. In the fourth month the subtle body gets formed. In the fourth month, inside the mother's womb, the foetus starts moving on its own.</p>

          <p align="justify">[11] If the movements of the foetus are felt towards the right side of the belly, it indicates that the child would be a male and if the movements are felt towards the left side, it indicates a female child.</p>

          <p align="justify">[12] In the same fourth month other organs get formed like, fingers, nails, etc. However, the moustaches, teeth, etc. do not get formed inside the womb.</p>

          <p align="justify">[13] O Rama! The male remains with steadiness in feelings and the female becomes fickle in feelings after the fourth month.</p>

          <p align="justify">[14] The heart gets inherited from the mother's heart itself. Hence, it desires whatever the mother desires. Therefore, for the betterment of the foetus, one must fulfil the mother's wishes without fail.</p>

          <p align="justify">[15] If one doesn't fulfil the wishes of a pregnant woman, then her child has chances to be born handicapped, or weak, or with poor intellect.</p>

          <p align="justify">[16] In that stage the mother literally carries two hearts. Therefore, she is called by the name 'Dauhridini'.</p>

          <p align="justify">[17] In the fifth month the foetus gains little knowledge, and in the body, flesh and blood get formed. In the sixth month, the bones, nerves, nails, hair, etc. get improved.</p>

          <p align="justify">[18] In the seventh month, the foetus gains full shape and remains in full strength.</p>

          <p align="justify">[19] The foetus thinking of the good and bad deeds done in the past remains sad and feels sorry.</p>

          <p align="justify">[20] It repents thinking how it remained inside the hellish place called womb, how it got baked under the heat of womb, how it slept in between the blood, flesh and other stinking materials, how it was bitten by the worms of the womb, how it got tortured by the pressure of the bones of the mother.</p>

          <p align="justify">[21] It thinks that the hellish womb is far worse than even the darkest of the hells. In this way, it repents for the past deeds and feels bad about the womb dwelling experience.</p>

          <p align="justify">[22] Inside the womb, the foetus drinks the mother's blood and eats whatever is present inside the stomach.</p>

          <p align="justify">[23] The suffering felt inside the womb is far higher than the pain given in all the hells summed together. </p>

          <p align="justify">[24] In this way Jiva thinks about the bad deeds done in the past, the undergoing torture, and cries for liberation.</p>

          <p align="justify">[25] In the eighth month, the skin around the foetus gets moving and from the heart, the foetus gains 'Ojas' and 'Tejas'. These two remain as the basis for life.</p>

          <p align="justify">[26] If by fortune the child takes birth in that month, it remains with vigour throughout life.</p>

          <p align="justify">[27] In the ninth month before the birth takes place, the child remains in a shape which resembles as if someone is carrying a heavy load on one's shoulders.</p>

          <p align="justify">[28] Inside the womb, the child gets nourished through the umbilical cord connected to the mother.</p>

          <p align="justify">[29] During the birth process, the child slips out of the door of bones and flesh called vagina and the child takes birth passing through the skin bag, blood and fluids.</p>

          <p align="justify">[30] Now, I would narrate the sequences of the stages through which the infant passes after the birth.</p>

          <p align="justify">[31] The infant remains sorrowful after falling out of the vagina in the world. Thereafter because of lack of strength in self-protection from wild animals or any other dangers, they remain under the protection of its caretakers. Therefore, childhood is difficult.</p>

          <p align="justify">[32] The child loses all past memory after a few seconds of falling into this world, they see the father as a demon and the mother as a demoness, and milk as a pious drink. Till the time, the 'Sushumna' nerve remains covered with phlegm, the child remains unable to speak.</p>

          <p align="justify">[33] Next stage is adult age, in which they fall prey to lust and become bound under attachments. They become proud of their strengths, wealth and soar high in the sky. They don't leave anyone unaffected by the negative qualities like lust, anger, greed, etc.</p>

          <p align="justify">[34] Filled with a stinking odour, huge like a torn belly of a frog, made up of bones, flesh and nerves is the vagina of a woman. On such a disgusting organ, one develops affection and becomes filled with lust for the same.</p>

          <p align="justify">[35] When bitten by the beauty of women, one fails to understand the fleeting nature of the perishable beauty.</p>

          <p align="justify">[36] Now, when one enters old age, they live in constant pain and sorrow. The body fails to digest the eaten food. The teeth become loose and fall, the eyesight deteriorates, the back becomes curved. They become strengthless and helpless.</p>

          <p align="justify">[37] Failing to keep themselves clean, falling in filth and excreta, failing to remain spiritually pious as well. They become the object of scornful treatment from their family.</p>

          <p align="justify">[38] With shivering limbs, with organs of deteriorated functions, they become an object of mockery by the children and young ones. Because of sickness, there remains no limit to the suffering.</p>

          <p align="justify">[39] Similar to how an eagle attacks a snake even if it is hidden in the waters. Likewise, even if surrounded by all the family members, in the end one becomes prey to the demigod of death.</p>

          <p align="justify">[40] O Sweetheart! O my wealth! O dear friends! Like this human cries out for help while being gobbled by death as like a frog cry in the clasp of a snake. The suffering experienced at the time of death, that pain can't be expressed in words.</p>

          <p align="justify">[41] One who remains filled with desire for liberation, remembers the Paramatma always. No one exists who protects one from the noose of Yama's attendants.</p>

          <p align="justify">[42] The ignorant one dies a pathetic death. One calls out the relatives for help, looks at everyone with pitiful eyes to satisfy oneself when the speech abandons. In order to avoid such suffering, the only way is divine knowledge and remembrance of the divinity.</p>

          <p align="justify">[43] Taking painful hiccups, getting dragged away by death, for such a person what is there as protection?</p>

          <p align="justify">[44] One who rides on the worldly life, one who is clasped by the Yama's attendants, where is the way to freedom for him?</p>

          <p align="justify">[45] With too many outstanding questions in mind, Jiva leaves this body painfully. After that, it enters the pain body in hell. It suffers various tortures and punishments there.</p>

          <p align="justify">[46] And the body which it left, which it used to smear sandalwood paste fondly once upon a time, that body which used to be decorated with silk clothes, and ornaments, such a dead body becomes an object of contempt. And without any further delay it gets taken away out of the house.</p>

          <p align="justify">[47] After that the lifeless body is cremated, or buried, or if thrown away it becomes a prey to scavengers.</p>

          <p align="justify">[48] In this world created through illusion, the relationships of mother, father, teacher and relatives become falsified after death. Because of one's own actions, one takes birth alone and leaves the world alone. </p>

          <p align="justify">[49] This world is equivalent to a resting place like a tree. The way birds assemble on a common tree at night and again disperse in their own paths in the morning, in the same way everyone meets and departs from each other based on their own past actions.</p>

          <p align="justify">[50] Death becomes the cause for rebirth, and birth becomes the cause for death and this cycle moves perpetually.</p>

          <p align="justify">[51] From the point male seed gets discharged in the womb of a female, till the death and rebirth, this vicious cycle is inevitable for any Jiva.</p>

          <p align="justify">[52] There is no other way than my remembrance to get liberated out of this world.</p>
