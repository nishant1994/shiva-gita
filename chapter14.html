          <h1 class="mt-4"><u>CHAPTER 14</u></h1>
          <h1 class="mt-4">THE FIVE BODILY SHEATHS</h1><br>

          <p align="justify">[1] Rama Said: O Bhagavan! How is it possible to realise the 
            self which is pure knowledge and bliss, sinless, which is serene, 
            beyond all dharmas, which is beyond all senses, even beyond 
            the limits of upanishads, and formless?</p>

          <p align="justify">[2] Sri Bhagavan Said: O Rama! Listen to the methods of 
            realising such self.</p>

          <p align="justify">[3] By doing the worship of god in form, one should learn the 
            concentration of mind. Thereafter, one should establish oneself 
            in meditation and realise the formless self.</p>

          <p align="justify">[4] The gross body which is formed from food, which is subject 
            to ageing, disease, and death contains the unchanging 
            knowledge of self, which neither takes birth nor dies.</p>

          <p align="justify">[5] The gross body has six states; it is born, exists, it changes, 
            grows, declines, and it dies.</p>

          <p align="justify">[6] The sky present inside a pot doesn't have a death even if the 
            pot breaks, similarly, the soul remains untouched even though 
            it remains inside the ever-changing gross body.</p>

          <p align="justify">[7] The way there is a food body, similarly there is an energy 
            body. That is also not the soul because it is subject to hunger and thirst.</p>

          <p align="justify">[8] The Jiva after realising the true self, which is pure 
            consciousness and bliss, is called Paramatma. It doesn't want 
            the fruits of any actions.</p>

          <p align="justify">[9] Inside the energy body, there exists a mental body which 
            comprises senses and intellect. The mental body is responsible 
            for all the ideas and decisions. Lust, anger, greed etc. are the 
            qualities generated by this mental body.</p>

          <p align="justify">[10] The feeling of 'I am the doer' belongs to the wisdom body. 
            It is also called Jiva.</p>

          <p align="justify">[11] The sense organs are generated from the Sattva portions of 
            the five elements. Ears were generated from the sky. From earth 
            came nose, from water; tongue, from fire; eyes, and from air 
            came skin.</p>

          <p align="justify">[12] Again from the Sattva nature of the five elements, the 
            intellect and mind have taken birth. In that, the intellect is the 
            one which makes the decisions. Mind is fickle or restless.</p>

          <p align="justify">[13] From the Rajas quality of the five elements, the five organs 
            of action; speech, hands, feet, anus and sex-organ were 
            generated. Also, the five major winds were generated.</p>

          <p align="justify">[14] Five sense organs, five organs of action, five major winds, 
            mind, intellect, ego, and memory. These seventeen components 
            are the constituents of the subtle body.</p>

          <p align="justify">[15] This subtle body remains the witness of all actions. Hence, 
            it is called a bliss body.</p>

          <p align="justify">[16] Bliss body is the one which enjoys the fruits of actions here 
            and in higher abodes also.</p>

          <p align="justify">[17] One should consider this body as the chariot, Jiva as the 
            passenger, intellect as the charioteer, mind as the reins, senses 
            as the horses, and the visible world as the field where those 
            horses wander.</p>

          <p align="justify">[18] The devotee always worshipping me discards all bodily 
            coverings, and finally realises the actual essence called soul.</p>

          <p align="justify">[19] Lord Shiva said: O Mighty Rama! This is it. No need to 
            worry about these things. This maya which comprises Sattva, 
            Rajas and Tamas qualities cannot be sailed across by anyone.</p>

          <p align="justify">[20] Only those who surrender themselves to me totally and 
            take my refuge, such humans only get ferried from this maya.</p>

          <p align="justify">[21] O Rama! People devoid of devotion and faith in me, do 
            actions expecting returns, and get the decaying fruition of their 
            actions. Ignorant people who run after the enjoyments to gain 
            temporary happiness, they take birth again and again from the 
            wombs of mothers.</p>

          <p align="justify">[22] They repeatedly keep going inside the mouth of death and 
            experience innumerable sorrows in life. After taking billions of 
            births from many wombs, there exists one in a billion who due 
            to accumulated virtues gets devoted to me.</p>

          <p align="justify">[23] That fortunate one who gains interest and devotion in me, 
            attains divine knowledge and liberation. One cannot gain this 
            knowledge by performing billions of actions. Therefore, 
            discard everything and focus only on me.</p>

          <p align="justify">[24] Rejecting everything else, take my refuge, I'll remove all 
            your sins and give liberation. Do not feel sorrowful about anything.</p>

          <p align="justify">[25] Therefore O Rama! Whatever you do, whatever you eat, 
            whatever you give as a donation, whatever austerities you 
            perform, offer everything to me.</p>

          <p align="justify">[26] To remain devoted to me is the best thing to do. There is 
            nothing superior to that.</p>
