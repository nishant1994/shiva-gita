          <h1 class="mt-4"><u>CHAPTER 15</u></h1>
          <h1 class="mt-4">THE YOGA OF DEVOTION</h1><br>

          <p align="justify">[1] Sri Rama said: O Shiva! What is meant by devotion to you? 
            How does it take birth? And how does one gain the supreme 
            happiness called liberation?</p>

          <p align="justify">[2] Sri Bhagavan said: One who studies scriptures regularly and 
            offers all actions to me, that is my favourite devotee.</p>

          <p align="justify">[3] One who applies the holy ash all over the body and worships 
            me with devotion; there is no other devotee dearer than this to me.</p>

          <p align="justify">[4] One who wears Rudraksha beads, one who constantly 
            chants my Panchakshari mantra, both these types of devotees 
            are my favourite and very dear to me.</p>

          <p align="justify">[5] One who applies holy ash all over the body, sleeps in the 
            ashes conquering wild senses, and recites Sri Rudra hymn with 
            a cleansed heart, and one who recites Atharvasiras hymns, and 
            studies Kaivalya upanishad, such a one attains liberation in the 
            very same life.</p>

          <p align="justify">[6] I'll tell you the details of the thing which is beyond the 
            dharma and adharma, which is beyond the cause and effect, and 
            which is beyond the past and future. Listen carefully!</p>

          <p align="justify">[7] The kind of supreme state which is the message of all the 
            Vedas. That is the Omkara, after knowing which people attain 
            the self, which is imperishable.</p>

          <p align="justify">[8] When compared to a cow, this Omkara is like a bull. This 
            is the one which liberates one from the miserable world.</p>

          <p align="justify">[9] The Pranava has four syllables; Akara (A), Ukara (U), 
            Makara (M), Ardhamatra (half syllable).</p>

          <p align="justify">[10] This entire creation with the past, present and future is 
            established in the Omkara.</p>

          <p align="justify">[11] That which is born, which is yet to be born, everything is 
            Rudra alone. All the life forces reside in the Lord.</p>

          <p align="justify">[12] Scriptures voice the fact that everything is nondual from 
            Rudra who is the Omkara. That's why Omkara and Shiva are 
            not different. Because the eternal self is established in this 
            Omkara, those who chant Omkara would get liberated for sure 
            beyond any doubts.</p>

          <p align="justify">[13] With the holy ash obtained from the sacrificial ground, one 
            who worships me by uttering Pranava, there doesn't remain 
            anyone second to such a devotee.</p>

          <p align="justify">[14] One who worships me with Bilva leaves while uttering 
            Pranava, that becomes my favourite devotee and gets merits 
            multiplied by a factor of billion.</p>

          <p align="justify">[15] One who is serene, honest, truthful, loves all creatures, 
            remains clean, is a conqueror of his senses, and studies the 
            scriptures to attain knowledge; such a devotee becomes my 
            most loved devotee.</p>

          <p align="justify">[16] In the early morning, one who goes to Shiva temple and 
            worships me would gain a lot of wealth, prosperity and after 
            death would merge with me.</p>

          <p align="justify">[17] Either on monday, or on the eleventh day in the fortnight 
            after the full moon day, one who worships me at night by 
            observing fasting, such a devotee would never run into any 
            problems in life.</p>

          <p align="justify">[18] Whosoever offers me the mixture of milk, curd, sugar, 
            honey and ghee called Panchamrita, water and forest flowers, 
            that becomes very dear to me.</p>

          <p align="justify">[19] One who stands inside water facing east and raises two 
            hands upwards considering me in the rising sun; one who 
            chants the Panchakshari mantra would enter my abode as easily 
            as one enters own house without any restrictions.</p>

          <p align="justify">[20] Therefore, O Rama! This knowledge of devotion as 
            preached by me when read by anyone, has the capability to 
            fulfil all desires and gives liberation. If you have further 
            questions to ask, you may do so without hesitation.</p>
