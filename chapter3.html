          <h1 class="mt-4">DECLARATION OF VIRAJA DIKSHA</h1><br>

          <p align="justify">[1] Sage Agastya said: A man who desires to die would not consent to take a healing medicine. Similarly, the one who has become a slave of lust turns deaf ears to the words of wisdom.</p>

          <p align="justify">[2] O Rama! Your wife Sita has been stolen away by illusionist demon Ravana and has been kept in his remote palace. How can such a lady come back to you?</p>

          <p align="justify">[3] That Ravana in whose palace demigods of heaven is enslaved, who gets fanned by the wives of those demigods.</p>

          <p align="justify">[4] Additionally, Ravana rules over the three worlds fearlessly due to the boons of Maheshvara. To defeat such a mighty demon, how is it possible for you? </p>

          <p align="justify">[5] Moreover, he has a son named Indrajit. Due to the blessings of Lord Shiva, he didn't taste defeat till date. Unable to stand in front of him, demigods also fled away many times.</p>

          <p align="justify">[6] On top of that, Kumbhakarna, another mighty demon, is Ravana's brother. Also, the immortal Vibhishana, having many divine weapons is also his brother.</p>

          <p align="justify">[7] The fort called Lanka, which is his capital, is impregnable to demigods and demons. Also, he has an army which consists of billions of horses, elephants, and soldiers. How is it possible for you alone to defeat him?</p>

          <p align="justify">[8] You have become a victim of desire and attachment. That's why you are thinking of defeating such a mighty demon. It looks like children trying to grab the moon in their fist.</p>

          <p align="justify">[9] Rama said: O Saint! I was born in the 'Kshatriya' clan. My consort Sita has been abducted by Ravana. Hence, what's the use of remaining alive if I can't rescue her from the trap of that evil Ravana. Therefore, there is no use if you preach me divine knowledge. My body is burning with anger. My ego is ready to take my life away.</p>

          <p align="justify">[10] The man whose wife gets abducted by an enemy, and during that moment of insult if a man gains interest in divine knowledge, then such a man is regarded as the lowest among men. Hence, suggest to me the way to cross the ocean and defeat my enemy, Ravana.</p>

          <p align="justify">[11] Sage said: In that case, take the refuge of the eternal Lord Shiva. The king of Lanka is unconquerable even to Indra and other deities including Brahma and Vishnu. Hence, without the grace of Lord Shiva, it is not possible for you to vanquish Ravana in battle. For this reason, I would initiate you under Viraja Diksha which pleases Lord Shiva.</p>

          <p align="justify">[12] By following that method, your human nature would get discarded and you would get filled with supreme aura. This method would fulfil your dream of vanquishing your enemy.</p>

          <p align="justify">[13] After that, Sri Rama prostrated to Sage Agastya, and became filled with happiness.</p>

          <p align="justify">[14] Sri Rama said: O Sage! I have become blessed today due to your grace. It looks like my wishes are going to be fulfilled now. You are the one who drank the entire ocean in three holy sips, when such a great sage has blessed me, how can I not succeed in achieving my goals? Therefore, initiate me at the earliest.</p>

          <p align="justify">[15] Sage said: Either on the eighth day, or eleventh day, or fourteenth day in the fortnight after the new moon, or else any monday which falls under 'Ardra' constellation, one should begin this vow called 'Viraja Diksha' austerity.</p>

          <p align="justify">[16] The Lord whom scriptures call 'Bhagavan' or the supreme personality of godhead, 'Mahadeva' or the greatest god, 'Shiva' or the auspicious, the father of all the demigods, that supreme god must be meditated upon.</p>

          <p align="justify">[17] One should worship the fire to subdue all the elements. Sage started narrating the steps of this vow as follows.</p>

          <p align="justify">[18] In the early morning, one should become purified by taking a bath, shouldn't eat anything, should wear clean clothes, and should make holy decisions.</p>

          <p align="justify">[19] One should apply the sandalwood paste of Bilva tree, should wear flower garlands, should subdue the incoming and outgoing breaths, should ignite fire by uttering mantras, and then apply the holy ash in three horizontal lines format all over the body. The one who applies ash in this manner, that person becomes freed of all sins. There is no doubt in this.</p>

          <p align="justify">[20] The one who controls the senses, bathes the body with the holy ash, sleeps in the ashes, and never leaves the ashes, such a person becomes freed of all kinds of sins and becomes one with Shiva.</p>

          <p align="justify">[21] O Rama! I would preach to you the thousand names of Lord Shiva. With the effect of those divine names, you can achieve all your dreams.</p>

          <p align="justify">[22] Sage Suta said: In this way that great sage preached Rama the thousand names of Shiva.</p>

          <p align="justify">[23] Sage said: O Rama! These thousand names of Shiva are a summary of the Vedas that can grant the devotee with the vision of Lord Shiva.</p>

          <p align="justify">[24] You should chant these thousand names of Shiva day and night tirelessly with full devotion. Consequently, if Shiva becomes pleased with you, then the Lord will give you the divine weapon. By possessing that weapon, you would become powerful enough for slaying your enemies and can gain your beloved wife back for yourself.</p>

          <p align="justify">[25] With the power of that divine missile, you can even dry up the limitless ocean. The weapon which acts as the primary cause behind the dissolution of universes during the end of time, unless that supreme weapon is possessed by you, victory over the demons is not possible.</p>

          <p align="justify">[26] For that reason, in order to gain that supreme weapon, take the refuge of the supreme lord.</p>
